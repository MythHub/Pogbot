# Contributing to Pogbot
## Getting started

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please get in contact with us on discord before doing so. We have everything tasked out over there and have a codeck setup with project scope. It is our goal to create a community that is inclusive and helpful. We're doing this project so that others can learn the process of creating a discord bot that runs on AWS. Join our community for more information, see the links below.
